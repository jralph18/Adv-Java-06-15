#W1D4-ReactRouter

1. Now that you have run through setting up React Router, take one of your existing React applications and build in this functionality.  

2. As an added challenge, try to implement the Bootstrap NavBar using React Router!

Bonus:

Now that you have built-in this functionality on an existing page, you can now do the same thing for another page. 

This time figure out how to do a login with the router. You can omit security checks, but have the page go from one to another.
